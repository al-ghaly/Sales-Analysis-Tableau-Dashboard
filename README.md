# Tableau Dashboard Analysis of Super Store Data

This repository hosts a Tableau dashboard project designed to dive deep into key performance metrics of a superstore's sales data across the United States. The project facilitates data-driven decision-making by enabling interactive data exploration through tailored visualizations.

### Project Introduction
The goal of this project is to analyze detailed sales metrics to uncover actionable insights. It features three specialized dashboards:
